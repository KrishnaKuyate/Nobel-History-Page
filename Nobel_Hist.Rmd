<font size="4">**The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way.**</font>

![](K2.jpg)

###For the greatest benefit to humankind

**Alfred Nobel was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist and businessman who also wrote poetry and drama.

**Since 1901, the Nobel Prize has been honoring men and women from around the world for outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and for work in peace.**

a. **Born: 21 October 1833**
b. **Died: 10 December 1896**
c. **Known for: inventing dynamite and holder of 355 patents**
d. **Professions: chemist, inventor, engineer, entrepreneur, businessman, author**
e. **Will: left 31 million SEK (about 265 million dollar today) to fund the prizes**

**Not only are there meaningless questions, but many of the problems with which the human intellect has tortured itself turn out to be only 'pseudo problems,' because they can be formulated only in terms of questions which are meaningless. Many of the traditional problems of philosophy, of religion, or of ethics, are of this character. Consider, for example, the problem of the freedom of the will. You maintain that you are free to take either the right- or the left-hand fork in the road. I defy you to set up a single objective criterion by which you can prove after you have made the turn that you might have made the other. The problem has no meaning in the sphere of objective activity; it only relates to my personal subjective feelings while making the decision**
